            Software
        </h3>
        <p>
            We prefer to keep our software stack as light as possible, so we will mainly use Java and JavaScript with some tools to support
            the languages. Use the OS you want.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">Java</a>
                <p>
                    Java is an object-oriented programming language which runs on the virtual JVM platform on any OS. A basic understanding of
                    OO such as <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/NETCode/archive/2013/08/07/the-basics---four-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming.aspx">the 4 pillars of OO</a>                    and using basic data structures such as Arrays and Maps is recommended. Look up some free Java learning
                    resources between workshops if there are concepts you feel unsure of.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank">Maven</a>
                <p>Maven is a build and infrastructure tool. It solves tedious tasks such as manging your dependencies (it'll
                    automatically download and resolve any thirdparty dependency you list in <code>POM.xml</code> which is
                    Maven's manifest file), compiling your code, run your tests, and package your application for deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Java projects we make for our workshops are made using Maven. This will give us a standardized way to run our code and
                    tests, and it means attendees only need to learn this one build tool (others are Gradle or Ant, for example).
                    <strong>In other words: learn Maven!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please read the getting started resources listed further down on this page and make a hello world Maven project in your editor,
                    be it Eclipse, Vim, IntelliJ or something else (we recommend IntelliJ Community Edition).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Make sure you have a working Maven installation and development environment (you can compile code and run tests) before the workshops!</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git</a>
                <p>
                    Git is a version control system (VCS) which is extremely popular these days. We use Git for checking code into a repository
                    when working on a project, especially when working in teams. There is a learning curve, but getting started
                    with the basics should be easy enough. We also have a Nerdschool workshop on Git.</p>
                <p>
                    The popular GitHub site (think Facebook for your git repositories) has a lot of excellent Git documentation and learning
                    material.
                    <strong>Take 15 minutes and go through their <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">interactive git tutorial</a></strong>                    for understanding the basics and check out their other documentation resources. There is also some very
                    nice cheat sheets for Git online, and while you should print one out and stick it near your monitor,
                    <a href="http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html">this interactive cheat sheet</a> is really good
                    to have bookmarked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A visual Git client such as <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> can be nice when getting started.
                </p>

            <li>
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition" target="_blank">IntelliJ Community Edition</a>
                <p>
                    IntelliJ is an IDE which can handle many programming languages and tools, but really excels at Java. IntelliJ is a modern,
                    elegant, and intuitive editor with clever refactorings and lots of helpful tools under the cover to help
                    you with some tedious tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Community Edition is free, and we recommend using this edition.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you prefer any other editor such as Eclipse, please feel free to use the editor of your choise, but make sure your environment
                    and configuration with Java and Maven works before the workshops. Learn how to open a Maven project in
                    your editor and how to compile and run tests.

                    An editor that understands JavaScript such as <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>,

        <h3>
            Services
        </h3>
        <ul>

            </a>Make sure your development environment and tools works
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Please make sure your Java installation works and that your Java class paths, SDK,
                and dependencies are set-up in the editor of your choise before the workshop!</strong> We only
            have 2.5 hours of actual work each session, so the less time spent fixing Java and missing/partial installs the
            better for everyone's sanity.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using your editor, create a new hello world project and ensure you can build/compile it using Maven.</li>
            <li>Also ensure that you can build and run a single unit test using jUnit. The test doesn't have to do anything,
                just build and run successfully.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h4>How to ensure Java is correctly installed</h4>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typing <code>java -version</code> or just <code>java</code> in a terminal should not produce an error</li>
            <li>If you do get an error, ensure your JDK bin folder is on your machine's PATH environment variable.
                <ul>

                                Path to Java (or the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> env. variable) is typically <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\bin</code>                                or similar depending on your version.
